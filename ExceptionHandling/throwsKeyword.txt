> throws keyword is used to throw checked exception(which can be caught by the compiler) by default(Java);
> or otherwise we can use try and catch to catch these checked exceptions;

********** Compile time error in checked exception ************

> Checked exception forces programmers to deal with the exception that may be thrown;
> IOException, SQLException, IllegalThredStateException, etc are checked exceptions;
> "checked" means they will be checked at compile time itself;

>> throws:
> A throws clause can be used in the method prototype;

> Syntax:

method() throws <ExceptionType1>, ..., <ExceptionTypeN>
{

}

> Example: Avoid checked exception using throws keyword

import java.io.*;
public class Example
{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException
    { 
        throw new IOException();
    }
}

> Example: Handle checked exception using try and catch

public class Example
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        try{
            throw new IOException();
        }
        catch(IOException e){
            System.out.println("Exception: "+e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}

> The throws keyword in Java programming language applies to a method to indicate that the method raises the 
  particular type of exception while being processed.

> The throws keyword in Java programming language takes arguments as a list of the objects of type 
  java.lang.Throwables class;
