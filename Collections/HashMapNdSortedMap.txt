> A HashMap contains values based on the key.
> Hash table data structure is used;
> It contains unique elements only;
> It may have one null key and multiple null values;
    > Next attempt to enter null as a key, it simply discards, without any error;

>> Methods of HashMap:

> public int size(): Returns the number of key-value mappings in this map.

> public boolean isEmpty(): Returns true if this map contains no key-value mappings.

> pubic V get(Object key): Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if this map contains 
                           no mapping for the key.


>> SortedMap:

> Child interface of Map;
> Whenever a group of key-value pairs needs to be stored in some sorted order, we use 
  SortedMap;
> Sorting logic applies on keys;

>> NavigableMap:

> It is a child interface of SortedMap;
> Several utility methods it provides to navigate in SortedMap;

>> TreeMap:

> It implements NavigableMap(so SortedMap and Map);
> Sorted order is maintained;
> It is not thread-safe;
> the map is sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys, or by 
  > a Comparator provided at map creation time, depending on which constructor is used;
> A Red-Black tree-based NavigableMap implementation;
