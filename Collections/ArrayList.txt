>> ArrayList:

    > ArrayList is defined using dynamic arrays;
    > Therefore it is resizable means it can grow and shrink automatically;
    > Duplicates are allowed;
    > Order of elements is preserved;
    > Null insertion is possible;
    > Except TreeSet and TreeMap Heterogeneous objects are allowed;

>> ArrayList: Constructors

> ArrayList a = new ArrayList();
  > Creates an empty ArrayList object with default initial capacity "10" if ArrayList reaches its max capacity
    then a new ArrayList object will be created with:
        > New capacity=(current capacity*3/2)+1

> ArrayList a = new ArrayList(int initialCapacity);
  > Creates an empty ArrayList object with the specified initial capacity;

> ArrayList a = new ArrayList(Collection c);
  > Creates an equivalent ArrayList object for the given Collection;
