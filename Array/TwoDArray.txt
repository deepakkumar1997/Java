>> Distinct length feature in 2d array:

> In java it is possible to declare a 2d array with different length of each array;
Example:

public class Example{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int[][] arr = new int[4][];
        a[0] = new int[5];
        a[1] = new int[3];
        System.out.println("Length = "+a[1].length); // output: 3
    }
}
