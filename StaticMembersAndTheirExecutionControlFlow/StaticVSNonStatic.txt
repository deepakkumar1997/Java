***************** Static VS Non-static Context ************************
> There are only two contexts in Java i.e. 
    > Static Context -> Class level: This is for the entire class no matter how many objects of that class you create.
      They will all share the same static context. Whether it is blocks, properties or methods and all the objects.
    > Non-static Context -> Object level
