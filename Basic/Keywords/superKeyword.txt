 **************************** super keyword *****************************
 > In inheritance, subclass object when call an instance member function of subclss only, function contains 
   implicit reference variables 'this' and 'super' both referring to the current object(Object of subclss);
   > The only difference in 'this' and 'super' is:
    > 'this' reference variable is of subclass type;
    > 'super' reference variable is of superclass type;

>> Use of super keyword:
   > If your method overrides one of its superclass's method, you can invoke the overriden method(superclass
    version) through the use of the keyword super;
   > It avoids name conflict between member variables of superclass and subclass;

Example:
class A {
  int z;
  public void f1(){

  }
}
class B extends A{
  int z;
  public void f1(){
    super.f1(); // It will call parent class method f1()
  }
  public void f2(){
    int z;
    z = 1;
    this.z = 2;// this refers current class member variable 'z';
    super.z = 3; // this refers parent class member variable 'z';
  }
}
class Example{
  public static void main(String []args){
    B obj = new B();
    obj.f1();
    obj.f2();
  }
}
