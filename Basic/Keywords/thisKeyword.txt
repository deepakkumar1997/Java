*************************** 'this' is a reference variable *************************************

> "this" is a predefined instance variable to hold current object reference;

> The 'this' object reference is a local variable in instance member methods referring the caller object;

> 'this' keyword is used as a reference to the current object which is an instance of the current class;

> The 'this' reference to the current object is useful in situations where a local variable hides, or shadows,
  a field with the same name;

> If a method needs to pass the current object to another method, it can do so using the this reference;

> Note that the this reference cannot be used in a static context, as static code is not executed in the
  context of any object;

Example:
class Box{
    private int l,b,h;
    public void setDimension(int l, int b, int h){// intstance member method 
        this.l = l;
        this.b = b;
        this.h = h;
    }
    public void sendBox(){
        GiftTaker gf = new GiftTaker();
        gf.receiveGift(this);
    }
}
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){ // static member method 
        Box b1 = new Box();
        b1.setDimension(2,4,6);
        b1.sendBox(); // another use of this 
    }
}
