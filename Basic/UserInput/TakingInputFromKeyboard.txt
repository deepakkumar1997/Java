> We can read java input from System.in using Scanner class;
> Scanner is final class, that can not be extended;
> Scanner class is a part of java.util.package;

Example:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        // Here System.in represents or telling scanner that data is coming from keyboard buffer;
        System.out.println("Enter a number: ");
        int num = scan.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Square of "+num+" is "+(num*num));
    }
}

> System.in is a reference variable which referes to that System which is connected to the keyboard;
> So from keyboard input comes to an intermediate loacation which we can call it buffer and from buffer the 
  Scanner class takes the data and then it is parsed;

>> Useful methods for taking input:

> next() // for taking one word input Here space works as a delimeter
> nextLine() // for taking Multiple word input(with whitespace)
> nextBoolean() // for taking boolean input 
> nextByte()
> nextDouble()
> nextFloat()
> nextInt()
> nextLong()
> nextShort()

>> Scanner Class:

> A Scanner breaks its input into tokens using a delimeter pattern, which by default matches whitespace;
> The resulting tokens may then be converted into values of different types using the various next methods;
