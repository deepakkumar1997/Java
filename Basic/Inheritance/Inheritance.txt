******************************** Inheritance *********************************
> It is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of a parent object;

> Syntax:
class SubClass extends SuperClass
{

}
> extends is a keyword
> Base class means Super Class;
> Derived class means Sub Class;

>> Remember:
> In the Java programming language, each class is allowed to have one direct SuperClass, and each SuperClass has
  the potential for an unlimited number of subclasses;
  > That means in java a class can't have more than one SuperClass but unlimited subclasses;
  > THat means in java multiple inheritance is not supported; Muliple inheritance means multiple parentes/SuperClass;

> Private members of the SuperClass are not accessible by the subclass and can only be indirectly accessed;
    > That means private members of SuperClass is only available in subclass but not accessible;
    > To know more about availability vs accesssibility; google it;

> Members that have default accessibility in the superclass are also not accessible by subclass in other package;

>> Java supports:
    > Single Inheritance e.g. A -> B 
    > Multi-level Inheritance e.g. A->B->C 
    > Hierarchical Inheritance e.g. A->B, A->C
