>> How to compile?
> First of all source code or .java file gets compiled and converted into byte code 
  that is nothing but .class file;

>> How to run?
> Then this byte code will be executed by JVM(java virtual machine) which acts as a
  interpreter between byte code and Operating System;
  > So what happens when we run byte code or .class file then JVM interprets line by
    line code and sends it to OS and while OS executes one line of code at that time
    JVM interpreting or converting line by line code to machine understandable code;

> In java, it is not possible to make a function which is not a member of any class;
  as we can do in C++;
