  public class HelloWorld{
    // correct
  }
  class HelloWorld{
    // correct
  }
  private class HelloWorld{
    // incorrect
  }
  protected class HelloWorld{
    // incorrect

> But an inner class can be public, private, protected, or default;

>> We can have only one pubic class in a single java file;
>> Name of the file should be same as the name of public class;
>> In absence of public class, any class name can be given to the file name;
