*********************************** Abstract Methods *****************************************

> An abstract class can include methods that contain no implementation. These are called abstract methods. The
  abstract method declaration must then end with a semicolon rather than a block;

> If a class has any abstract methods, whether declared or inherited, the entire class must be declared abstract;
> If an abstract method is overriden in subclass then no need to declare subclass as abstract;

Example:

abstract class Person{
    abstract void show();
}
class Student extedns Person{
    // If you're not overriding parent's abstract method then you've to make subclass as abstract
    // But if you're overriding then no need
    void show(){
        System.out.println("Deepak");
    }
}
class AbstractExample{
    public static void main(String []args){
        Student s = new Student();
        s.show();
    }
}
