**************************************** Abstract Class *****************************************

> An abstract class cannot be instantiated;
> Abstract classes are declared with the abstract keyword;

Example:

abstract class Person{
    private String name;
    private int age;
    public void setName(String name){
        this.name = name;
    }
    public void setAge(int age){
        this.age = age;
    }
}
class AbstractExample{
    public static void main(String []args){
        Person p = new Person(); // This will throw an error as abstract class can't be instantiated;
    }
}

> Java Abstract classes are used to declare common characteristics of subclass;
> It can only be used as a superclass for other classes that extend the abstract class;
> Like any other class, an abstract class can contain fields that descirbe the characteristics and methods that
  descirbe the actions that a class can perform;

> You can not create object of abstract class but you can create reference variable of abstract class;
