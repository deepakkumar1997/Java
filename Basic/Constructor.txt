**************************************** CONSTRUCTOR *******************************************
> Constructor is a member function of a class;
> The name of constructor is same as the name of the class;
> Constructor has no return type;

> Any access modifiers can be used before a constructor();

Example:

public class Box{
    private int l,b,h;
    // Non-parameterized constructor
    public Box(){
        l=10;
        b=8;
        h=4;
    }
    // Parameterized constructor
    public Box(int l, int b, int h){ // and this is constructor overloading 
        this.l = l;
        this.b = b;
        this.h = h;
    }
    public static void main(String []args){
        Box b1 = new Box(); // First constructor i.e. Non-param constructor will be automatically called;
        Box b2 = new Box(20,12,5);// Second one i.e. Parameterized constructor will be automatically called;

    }
}

>> A constructor is a special method that is used to initialize a newly created object and is called implicitly,
   just after the memory is allocated for the object;
>> It is not mandatory for the coder to write a constructor for the class;
>> When there is no constructor defined in the class by programmer, compiler implicitly provide a default 
   constructor for the class;
>> Constructor can be parameterized and it can be overloaded;
