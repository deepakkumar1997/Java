>> Method Overloading:
> If two methods of a class (whether both declared in the same class, or both inherited by a class, or one 
  declared and one inherited) have the same name but signatures(type or number of parameters) that are not
  same, then the method name is said to be overloaded;

> Method overloading is a way to implement polymorphism;

> Method signature consists of Method Name, Number Of Arguments, Types Of Arguments and Order Of Arguments;
