 ************************** Access Modifiers ***************************

 > Java supports four categories of accessibility rules 
    > private
    > protected
    > public
    > default

> Modifiers can be used for class, member variables, and member functions;

>> With class:
> Outer class and inner class;
> For outer class, there can be only two possibilities, either class is a public 
  class or just a class which means it is of default type;
> For inner class any among four access modifiers can be used;

>> Remember:
> There can be only one public class in a single java file;
> The name of the java file must be the same as the name of the public class;
> Only public class can be accessed directly from outside the package;

>> Member variables and functions:
> When members of the class are private, they can not accessed from outside the class body; They are meant to be
  accessed from the same class in which they are declared;
> When members are protected, they can be accessed from any class of the same package and child class from other
  package;
> When members are public, they are accessible from any class of any package;
> When members are default, they are accessible only from the class of same package;

>> If you're in same package and want to use class from other java file then you don't need to import that 
   package in order to use the classes inside current package;
